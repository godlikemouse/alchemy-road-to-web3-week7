# Alchemy's Road to Web3 Week 7

This repository covers the modified code following Alchemy's Road to Web3 Week 7.

This code is for the Tutorial [Build your own NFT Marketplace from Scratch](https://docs.alchemy.com/alchemy/) built by [alchemy.com](https://alchemy.com)

## Development Setup

    npm i

Create a `.env` file at the root of this project and add the following:

    REACT_APP_ALCHEMY_API_URL=
    REACT_APP_PRIVATE_KEY=
    REACT_APP_PINATA_KEY=
    REACT_APP_PINATA_SECRET=

The `REACT_APP_ALCHEMY_API_URL` can be obtained from creating an application on Alchemy.com. The `REACT_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` comes from your development MetaMask account export.

The `REACT_APP_PINATA_KEY` and `REACT_APP_PINATA_SECRET` comes from app.pinata.cloud under API Keys.
